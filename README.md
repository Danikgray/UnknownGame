# JSnake game
A simple snake game written in java with self-written UI on top of the libGDX framework

### Things that I want to do in the game
- [ ] Make multiple UI scenes for different menus
- [ ] Maybe create multiple different UI elements
- [ ] Simple element creation in scenes
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Settings menu(maybe not necessary)
- [ ] Different display sizes support
- [ ] Create at least not shitty looking textures
- [ ] Create a smooth animations for the snake(maybe not)
- [ ] Refactor the code and make it readable
- [ ] ~~Maybe create a multiplayer mode~~

That all for now I guessðŸ¤§
